    One of the insights that came out of designing the information landscape is the ability to utilize its form or shape as a representation. This is a technique we see employed in way-finding in real life. To represent a subway station or an airport, we use icons of the thing youâ€™ll be using there ðŸš‡ðŸ›«. This is something we could employ with an app icon. Having the stadium view represent what is in the app.

    In this new era of spatial computing, representing an app with an icon that visually corresponds to its function offers multiple advantages. Primarily, it facilitates users in associating the app with its intended purpose, enhancing usability and recognition.

    In our case, we know just how much of a struggle it is to choose the right icon for an app, so we decided to cheat and let the app interface be the representationâ€¦.. lol
